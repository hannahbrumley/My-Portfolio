## About Me

Hi, I'm Hannah Brumley, a passionate software developer with a diverse skill set that spans backend development, front-end engineering, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering principles. I have a Master's in Information Technology and a Graduate Certificate in Cybersecurity, which has deepened my technical expertise.

The projects featured in this portfolio are primarily from coursework and personal projects I’ve completed over the past few years. They represent the foundational skills I have developed in software development, problem-solving, and system design. While some of these projects are from earlier coursework, they provide insight into my approach to learning new technologies, designing systems, and building real-world applications.

Whether it's building a CRUD database system, developing a console-based library management system in C++, or creating a web-based inventory search application, each project reflects my commitment to improving my coding abilities and understanding complex concepts. As I continue to grow professionally, I aim to refine these skills further and contribute to impactful projects that solve real-world problems.

Feel free to explore my projects, where you can dive deeper into each one’s specific functionality, implementation, and challenges I faced. Thank you for taking the time to check out my work!
